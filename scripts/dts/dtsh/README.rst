**DTSh** is an interactive *shell-like* interface with Devicetree.

- walk a devicetree through a hierarchical file-system metaphor
- search for nodes with flexible criteria
- filter, sort and format commands output
- generate simple documentation artifacts (text, HTML, SVG) by redirecting commands output to files
- rich Textual User Interface: command line auto-completion, command history, custom theme
